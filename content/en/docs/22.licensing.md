# Licensing

The MIT license applied to most framework packages permits you to use them without any limitations in personal and commercial projects alike.

Certain plugins are classified as advanced and have a dual license. They can be used freely in personal non-profit projects, but require additional agreements (under development) for the use of these plugins or their code parts in commercial projects. To know more about using these plugins in commercial projects, you can contact us at info@retejs.org
