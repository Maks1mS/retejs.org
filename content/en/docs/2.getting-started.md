# Getting started


## Playgrounds

- [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/rete-js-v2-yrzxe5)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Ni55aN/pen/rNZKejd)

## Creating an application using devkit

Use [Rete Kit](/docs/development/#rete-kit) to quickly set up a Rete.js application. It lets you select a stack (**React.js**, **Vue.js** or **Angular**) and the set of features.

## Adding Rete.js to your application

Framework packages are available on NPM and support common formats like ES (.esm.js), CommonJS (.common.js), and UMD (.min.js).

The command below provides an example of how to install the framework packages for the current Beta version.

```bash
npm i rete@next rete-area-plugin@next rete-connection-plugin@next rete-render-utils@next rete-react-render-plugin@next react react-dom
```

For specific information on the required packages, refer [one of the guides](/docs/guides/basic)


## Usage from CDN

Framework packages are also available on numerous CDNs that serve npm packages. To add them to an HTML page, use the following example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete@next/rete.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-area-plugin@next/area-plugin.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-connection-plugin@next/connection-plugin.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-render-utils@next/render-utils.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rete-react-render-plugin@next/react-render-plugin.min.js"></script>
```

Use these packages by accessing their namespace, which can be found in the `name` field of `rete.config.ts` file for each package. Make sure to add the required peer dependencies

```js
Rete
AreaPlugin
ConnectionPlugin
ReactRenderPlugin
```

Furthermore, you can integrate them on platforms like [Codepen](https://codepen.io) using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh).
