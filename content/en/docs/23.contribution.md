# Contribution

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Before you get started, please make sure to review our [Code of conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct) and [Licensing](/docs/licensing). By contributing to our project, you agree to comply with the code of conduct and license your contributions in line with our licensing terms.

## Code contribution {#code}

The contribution process follows the standard Github method of forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

When submitting a pull request, make sure to reference the relevant issue if applicable. For improvements, provide a detailed explanation of the changes and their rationale. We also recommend discussing the issue in the GitHub issues section prior to submitting the pull request to ascertain whether the problem is common and if the proposed enhancement can be implemented as a standalone package or requires modification of the current codebase.

- Follow the [Style guide](/docs/development/#style-guide)
- Keep pull requests small and focused on a single issue or topic
- Write simple and meaningful unit tests for new code that you're contributing
- Test changes using Rete QA and, if possible, add E2E tests for new features

When making changes to the code, keep in mind any potential breaking changes and try to use plugins to extend functionality whenever possible instead of modifying the existing code. This approach aligns with the project architecture's goal of minimizing the need for core code changes.

Check out the [Development](/docs/development) page for a more in-depth guide on developing plugins.

## Testing and Bug reporting {#testing}

Testing the project in various environments (browsers, build tools) and reporting bugs is greatly appreciated. [Rete Kit](/docs/development/#rete-kit) tool can assist in testing the project with various frameworks by allowing you to easily create a basic editor for the required version.

If you come across a bug, please report it by creating an issue in the appropriate GitHub repository. If you're not sure where the error comes from, create an issue in the main repository. Your ticket should include detailed steps to reproduce the issue.

Please ensure that there is no previous ticket created with the same problem. If one exists, you can add a comment with a detailed description of the issue from your perspective or add reaction (this is also important).
