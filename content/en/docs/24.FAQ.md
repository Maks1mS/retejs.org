# FAQ

::questions
  ::qa{question="How to develop my own plugin?"}
    Check out the [instructions](/docs/development#create-plugin) for Rete Kit
  ::
  ::qa{question="Can the graph be processed on the server-side, such as Node.js?"}
    Yes, follow the [Dataflow](/docs/guides/processing/dataflow) or [Control flow](/docs/guides/processing/control-flow) guides
  ::
  ::qa{question="Can the graph be processed using Python or other server-side programming languages?"}
    The engine only supports JS runtime. You can either bind JS into your environment or implement your own engine, similar to `rete-engine` (it has a straightforward implementation)
  ::
  ::qa{question="Can the framework be used for commercial purposes?"}
    In short, yes. Refer to the [Licensing](/docs/licensing) for details
  ::
  ::qa{question="Can I use the framework if I don't know TypeScript?"}
    It can be used in JS code, but not recommended because of poor DX
  ::
  ::qa{question="Is there a way to save a graph as a JSON file?"}
    Yes, follow the [Import/export](/docs/guides/import-export) guide
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to disable scroll prevention?"}
    Replace zoom handler with `null` or use a custom one

    ```ts
    const area = new AreaPlugin(container)

    area.area.setZoomHandler(null)
    ```
  ::
  ::qa{question="How can I automatically arrange the position of nodes?"}
    Follow the [Arrange nodes](/docs/guides/arrange) guide
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to force an update on nodes or controls?"}
    Call the following methods for the corresponding nodes or controls after making changes to the state

    ```ts
    const area = new AreaPlugin(container)

    area.update('node', node.id)
    area.update("control", control.id);
    ```
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to render various nodes or controls using Angular, React, and Vue in one editor?"}
    Check out the [Combining render plugins](/docs/concepts/integration#combine) in the [Integration](/docs/concepts/integration) article
  ::
  ::qa{question="How can I add my own elements to the editor area?"}
    Use the methods of `content` property of the area plugin

    ```ts
    const area = new AreaPlugin(container)

    area.content.add(element)

    area.content.remove(element)
    ```
    It's also possible to make this element draggable

    ```ts
    const dragHandler = new Drag()

    dragHandler.initialize(element, { /* getters */ }, { /* events */ })
    ```
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to customize nodes?"}
    Check out the relevant customization guide for [React.js](./guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](./guides/renderers/vue#customization) or [Angular](./guides/renderers/angular#customization)
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to collapse the node (to minimize a node's size by hiding its controls)?"}
    Define how elements should be hidden when the node is collapsed by creating a custom node component.

    Check out the relevant customization guide for [React.js](./guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](./guides/renderers/vue#customization) or [Angular](./guides/renderers/angular#customization).
  ::
  ::qa{question="What are the steps to implement render plugin for other framework?"}
    - [Setup a plugin](./development/#create-plugin)
    - Use the source code of the following packages as a reference: [React.js](https://github.com/retejs/react-render-plugin), [Vue.js](https://github.com/retejs/vue-render-plugin), or [Angular](https://github.com/retejs/angular-render-plugin)

  ::
  ::qa{question="Is there way to prevent nodes from being moved while interacting with controls?"}
    You need to stop propagation of the `pointerdown` event.

    Check the relevant render plugin guide for controls: [React.js](guides/renderers/react#controls), [Vue.js](guides/renderers/vue#controls), [Angular](guides/renderers/angular#controls)

  ::
  ::qa{question="Why doesn't the control capture click/pointer events?"}
    By default, the area captures these events, so you need to stop the propagation of `pointerdown` event to prevent this

    Check the relevant render plugin guide for controls: [React.js](guides/renderers/react#controls), [Vue.js](guides/renderers/vue#controls), [Angular](guides/renderers/angular#controls)
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to add inputs, outputs or controls dynamically?"}
     You can add them as usual using the `addInput`/`addOutput`/`AddControl` methods, and then force a node update

    ```ts
    const area = new AreaPlugin(container)

    area.update('node', node.id)
    ```
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to add a control to the output?"}
    The process of adding such elements requires the creation of a custom node.

    Check out the relevant customization guide for [React.js](./guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](./guides/renderers/vue#customization) or [Angular](./guides/renderers/angular#customization).
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to create an undirected graph with nodes that don't have input/output sockets?"}
    :safety-tape{text="Under development"}
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to make an editor oriented vertically?"}
    Check out the [Vertical flow](/examples/vertical-flow) example
  ::
  ::qa{question="How to change the alignment of inputs/outputs?"}
    The process of changing the node layout requires the creation of a custom node.

    Check out the relevant customization guide for [React.js](./guides/renderers/react#customization), [Vue.js](./guides/renderers/vue#customization) or [Angular](./guides/renderers/angular#customization).
  ::
  ::qa{question="Is it possible to render UI using vanilla JS exclusively, without resorting to frameworks?"}
    In short, it is possible, but there is no plugin available for this approach since it doesn't offer significant advantages in comparison to the development costs
