# Integration

This framework is not bound to any UI rendering framework and can be integrated with the most popular frameworks/libraries such as **Angular**, **Vue.js**, **React.js**. The following rendering packages are available:

- [`rete-react-render-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-react-render-plugin)
- [`rete-vue-render-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-vue-render-plugin)
- [`rete-angular-render-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rete-angular-render-plugin)

The primary objective is to empower you to choose the visualization tools that align with your specific needs. Additionally, if you ever need to use the render plugin for a different framework within your application (such as during a project migration), you can easily do so. Please note that `rete-angular-render-plugin` is only compatible with Angular applications.

## Classic preset

By default, you can use the classic preset that has built-in components for:

- nodes
- connections
- some controls (numeric or text input fields)

```ts
import { AngularRenderPlugin, AngularArea2D, Presets as AngularPresets } from 'rete-angular-render-plugin'

const angular = new AngularRenderPlugin<Schemes, AngularArea2D<Schemes>>({ injector })

angular.addPreset(AngularPresets.classic.setup({ area }))

area.use(angular)
```

The framework allows you to swap out the pre-defined components with any other components as per your needs. The node component, in particular, can be customized extensively. Refer to the [Customization](../guides/renderers/react#customization) guide for more details

## Combining render plugins {#combine}

This framework version has improved approaches for combining various rendering frameworkswhile ensuring TypeScript support. For instance, you can render one node using **Vue.js** and another using **React.js**.

```ts
import { ReactArea2D, ReactRenderPlugin, Presets as ReactPresets } from 'rete-react-render-plugin'
import { VueArea2D, VueRenderPlugin, Presets as VuePresets } from 'rete-vue-render-plugin'

type AreaExtra =
  | ReactArea2D<Schemes>
  | VueArea2D<Schemes>

const reactPlugin = new ReactRenderPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>()
const vuePlugin = new VueRenderPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>()

reactPlugin.addPreset(ReactPresets.classic.setup({ area, customize: {
  node(data) {
    if (data.payload instanceof AddNode) return null // prevent rendering of AddNode by React.js
    return ReactPresets.classic.Node
  }
} }))
vuePlugin.addPreset(VuePresets.classic.setup({ area, customize: {
  node() {
    return VuePresets.classic.Node // render all nodes that weren't rendered by previously used render plugin
  }
} }))

// order matters
area.use(reactPlugin)
area.use(vuePlugin)
```

The `AddNode` node in this example is rendered using **Vue.js**, while all other nodes are rendered using **React.js**.

Using multiple frameworks at once may have performance drawbacks, but it can also offer a significant boost to prototyping speed when when time-to-market is critical.
