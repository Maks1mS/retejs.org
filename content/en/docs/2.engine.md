# Engine

This class allows you to process data based on streams in nodes and transfer them from the output data to the input. The engine does not depend on other components of the editor. All he needs is an identifier, component workers and JSON data

```typescript
var engine = new Rete.Engine('demo@0.1.0');

engine.register(myComponent);
await engine.process(data);
```

It can work independently from the Editor
