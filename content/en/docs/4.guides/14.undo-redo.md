#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i rete-history-plugin@next
```

#### Plugin connection

```ts
import { HistoryPlugin } from "rete-history-plugin";

const history = new HistoryPlugin<Schemes, AreaExtra>();

area.use(history);
```

#### Usage

The plugin doesn't track user actions by default, such as keyboard shortcuts. To enable user interaction, you can implement usage of `undo`/`redo` methods on your own

```ts
await history.undo()
await history.redo()
```

Alternatively, you can use the default extension that tracks the `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` shortcuts

```ts
import { HistoryExtensions } from "rete-history-plugin";

HistoryExtensions.keyboard(history);
```

Check out the complete result on the [History](/examples/history) example page.
