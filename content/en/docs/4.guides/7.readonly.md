This guide is based on the [Basic](./basic) guide. It is recommended to review it for a comprehensive understanding of this guide.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i rete-readonly-plugin@next
```

#### Connect the plugin

```ts
import { ReadonlyPlugin } from "rete-readonly-plugin";

const readonly = new ReadonlyPlugin<Schemes>();

editor.use(readonly.root);
editor.use(area);
area.use(readonly.area);
area.use(render);
```

Make sure to follow the order to connect `readonly.root` and `readonly.area` before any other plugins.

#### Enable

The plugin allows modifications to the editor by default, giving you the ability to establish the editor's initial appearance using methods such as addNode.

Use the following code to activate it:

```ts
readonly.enable();
```

#### Disable

Disabling can be done in a similar way:

```ts
readonly.disable();
```

#### Controls

When referring to the in-built controls provided by the framework, like `ClassicPreset.InputControl`, it's important to specify the readonly feature individually in the below manner:

```ts
new ClassicPreset.InputControl('text', { readonly: true })
```

Since other controls can be custom, it is up to the developer to implement their "read-only" capability.

#### Disable connection manipulation

Finally, if you have completed the [Basic](./basic) guide, make sure to remove the `ConnectionPlugin` import.

```ts
area.use(connection); // should be removed
```

Check out the complete result on the [Readonly](/examples/readonly) example page.
