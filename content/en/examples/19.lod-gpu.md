This example represents an improved version of [the LOD example](/examples/lod), allowing the visualization of thousands of nodes within a single editor. The improvement lies in rendering simplified versions of nodes and connections on the canvas, utilizing the GPU through [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com), whenever rendering the original node becomes unreasonable due to its small on-screen size.

Once the user zooms in, the original node is rendered at an appropriate level of detail, enabling user interaction.
