This example demonstrates the use of LOD (level of detail) to simplify nodes by replacing them with simplified versions at certain level of zoom. Nodes outside the viewport are also excluded from rendering. These methods enhance the performance of editors with a large number of nodes

Although this example was originally designed for React.js, the showcased feature is completely framework-agnostic. You can seamlessly integrate it into your application on a different stack by copying the feature module and connecting it into your editor.
