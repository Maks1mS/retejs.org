This example demonstrates several essential features:

- Round nodes
- Selectable connections
- Unified port for connections
- Removal of connections with a designated button located in the middle of the path
- Connections represented by straight lines and loops with markers at the end

:proExample{src="https://retejs-undirected.netlify.app"}

The classic preset is used for rendering, which involves splitting into input and output ports, but in this case, a trick is employed to pack them into a single unified socket, represented by a transparent circle slightly larger in radius than its node.

Custom components are used to represent the nodes and connections. The `rete-connection-path-plugin` plugin is used for setting up connection path and marker.

Instead of `getDOMSocketPosition`, a custom socket position calculator is used to ensure that the beginning and end of the connection coincide with the node's border.
