This is a simple demonstration of a chatbot whose behavior is programmed using a visual editor. In this implementation, all elements are customized, including animated connections. The chat window is presented as a separate node that can be moved only using special handles at the bottom and top. A dataflow and control flow-based engine is used to process the graph. There is also validation of connections by checking socket compatibility.

:example{id="rete-js-v2-chatbot-programming-nok9iq" module="/src/editor.ts"}

`DataflowEngine` and `ControlFlowEngine` are being used here, just like in the [Hybrid engine](/examples/processing/hybrid-engine) example.

Validation of connections carried out by extending `ClassicPreset.Socket` and including a corresponding method that takes in another socket as an argument and checks for compatibility. If the sockets are incompatible, a message is displayed and the connection is not added.
